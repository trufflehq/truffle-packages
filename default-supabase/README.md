# truffle-default-supabase

Default backend package that people can clone to get started building a Truffle webhook handler with
Supabase Edge Functions.

**NOTE:** We can't currently have front-end and backend packages live in the same repo
due to an [issue](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/13389) with the way Deno resolves `react/jsx-runtime`
during bundling.
