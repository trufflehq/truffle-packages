// NOTE: this lib *cannot ever* have any breaking changes
// it *can* be updated, without breaking changes, and can be versioned

// this is so the global context remains consistent between all components
// we have @truffle/global-context@1.0.0/index.js that needs to always return a backwards-compatible context

// There is some inconsistency between browser, Node.js, and Deno support async context tracking
// (context that persists across a single function call, even if child calls are async/callbacks)
// Node.js has AsyncLocalStorage: https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html
// Browsers don't have anything currently implemented.
//   - there was a proposal for Zones like Zone.js in ~2019 that was rejected for being too dangerous
//     - https://gist.github.com/mhevery/63fdcdf7c65886051d55
//     - https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/main/packages/zone.js
//   - there is a current proposal: https://github.com/legendecas/proposal-async-context
//     - this was last proposed in July 2020 and they weren't very receptive
//     - https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/167155eeb708d84e1758d99c88b15670f9b81f75/meetings/2020-07/july-23.md#async-context-updates--for-stage-1
// Deno doesn't have AsyncLocalStorage, but should have Promise hooks soon, that can support this behavior
//   - https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/5638

// Libraries also have their own version of context, like React's Provider / useContext.
// We don't want to be tied to that though - we want to let helper methods outside of React functions
// grab context successfully.

// We're going to go with the one implementation that exists: AsyncLocalStorage, but if/when the ES spec
// implements, it may differ (https://github.com/legendecas/proposal-async-context uses setValue/getValue)

// As a (hopefully) short-term solution for browsers, we'll use setGlobalValue(val) instead of run(val, fn).
// This context won't be scoped at all, it will be global per `new Context()` instance

// TODO: client should probably importmap this to nothing
// or could try dynamic import
