# truffle-create-vue-project

TODOS:

- Vite vue plugin needs to be able to import from 'https://npm.tfl.dev/vue@3'
  instead of 'vue'
- Get rid of package.json when above is done ^^
- Oscar esbuild needs to compile .vue to js
- Figure out how to do styles (the style tag in vue SFCs don't work currently)
- Figure out why reactive values using ref and reactive don't work (composition
  api)
- Figure out why importing a child component using the options api doesn't work
