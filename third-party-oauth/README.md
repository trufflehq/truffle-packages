# @truffle/third-party-oauth

## Deployment
Make sure to deploy to both the production and staging packages when creating a new package version. 

We host the production package at https://third-party-oauth.truffle.vip and the staging package at
https://platform-third-party-oauth.sporocarp.dev which pulls from the staging Truffle org.

This allows us to support YT OAuth on production with a verified OAuth consent as well as on staging for 
3rd party devs.
